            <h1>Do Emotions Matter?</h1>
            <div class="date">Tue 21 Feb 2023</div>
            <p>they are for sure part of one's own human true nature they are derived by
            our own actions and events that happens to us in our journey, but why modern 
            society put so much pressure or they made emotions so relevant. Do people get
            driven by them, do they let control and shape them? probably its humanly normal
            to be shapen by them, even if you try to control them, and guide them to their places
            they'll come back for you, and once you'll face them back they're gonna hit harder
            than ever. It has happened recently to me, once i resurfaced what i thought it was lost
            in the most small fragment of my "mind" they all surfaced back together, reminding of what
            I thought I once found I did not care, or better pretended to. Founding myself here razionalizing
            one of the most innate thing a human being has, not everything has to be logical and it is
            better this way, we care about emotions because they make us feel better, alert us or feel 
            pain to relief, and they are good the way they are. In addition Mindset its what might hold
            us back, or make us achieve the things that we want, with a good mindset every steps in our lifes
            might seem better even the setbacks are something that it is indeed important 'cause they remind you
            to keep yourself up and grown from each mistakes because every moments counts, every second can change
            the prospect of our future so why don't we learn from each experience and make ourselves better, for
            a better world and better grown within ourself. <br> 
            in Conclusion, yes they do.

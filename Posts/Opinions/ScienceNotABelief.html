            <h1>Science is not a Belief system</h1>
            <div class="date">Tue 21 Feb 2023</div>
            <p>in my life I've been actually discussing multiple times about
                this topic, with multiple persons, which they would've told me 
                "Yeah, i belive in science", as if science is a belif system likewise
                religions, well it's not true at all, because there's a big difference
                between religion and science.. and that is that one is based on empirical
                data, and proved all along while the other, its just some really old fantasy
                book in which none of the things written in it have any actual evidence.
                So it is indeed a belif system, something that you belive in order to make
                the information contained in them within yourself. Science it's based on the
                Scientific method which is indeed the most objective tool in the human history
                in which consist of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Observations: Scientists observe natural phenomena and gather data.</li>
                <li>Hypothesis: Based on those observations, they formulate a hypothesis, which is a tentative explanation for the observed phenomena.</li>
                <li>Predictions: The hypothesis is used to make predictions about other phenomena that can be tested experimentally.</li>
                <li>Experimentation: Scientists design experiments to test the predictions.</li>
                <li>Data Collection: They collect and analyze the data gathered from the experiment.</li>
                <li>Conclusion: Based on the analysis of the data, they draw conclusions about the validity of the hypothesis.</li>
                <li>Communication: Scientists communicate their results to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and other means.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>and only if replicable then it's possibily that the scientific community might accept it if it follows the logic needed and it's conclusions
                are widely accepted.</p>
            <p>an important note: scientists themselves may hold personal beliefs that are not directly related to their scientific work. However, these beliefs should not influence their scientific findings, which must be based on empirical evidence and logical reasoning. 
                (which lately we've seen with all the predatory "scientific publisher" accepting all sorts of paper, even the ones that have only ideology underneath it all)</p>
            <p>it's also thanks to science that we have all the commodities of modern life, without science all the electronic devices, phone, radio, light bulb, tv, satellite etc. would've not be here,   
                we would still fight probably for food and basic needs.
            </p>
            <p>Many people would object the reality of objectivity and might say that there's no thing such as "objective", because we are biased by our own limited sense and so on. well
               I do agree that our limited sense may lead us view the thing the way they might not be, <bold>BUT</bold> if we enter this kind line of thought we might end up as well as thinking
               that we might live in a dream or a simulation. we have to work with what we have, and not theorize (even tho is cool) on not provable things that might end up just as mere fantasized hypothesis. also
               even though our view might be limited by our own senses and biases, The Scientific Method delivers the best tool to minimize the influence of any subjective bias promoting objectivity through
               systematic observations and testing.
            </p>
            <p>Einstein's theory of relativity is a great example of how science can reveal aspects of reality that go beyond our everyday experiences and intuitions. One of the central concepts of relativity is that space and time are not absolute and fixed, but rather are interconnected 
                and influenced by the presence of matter and energy. This means that the geometry of space and time can be distorted by massive objects, such as stars or black holes, in ways that are not immediately perceptible to us in our daily lives. this kind of discovery was not derived from direct sensory experience or observation in the same way that Newton's theory of gravity was.
                Instead, it was developed through a combination of reasoning, observation, and experimentation -> which lead to a more "truer" true than newton theory of gravity which might be consider a "little" true if used in the context of earth but it would not work outside of our earth, as to why it's a little true of the nature of things.

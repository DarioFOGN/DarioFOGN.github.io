# Woke Capitalism

Here's the definition of "woke capitalism":



> "Woke capitalism" refers to a business strategy where companies attempt to align themselves with social justice causes and appeal to consumers who are concerned with issues such as racial and gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental sustainability. This approach involves not only taking a public stance on these issues but also implementing policies and practices that reflect these values within the company.



The problem with Woke Capitalism it's at the fundaments of where it stands as Company should in my opinion focus more on their actual product and on what they offer as the "mission" of the company instead of using progressive ideas as what the company represents. 

When they change it's own mission into things that the product is not even involved with, then we could get into the hypocrisy of doing it just for the appeal of the new generations which supports this beliefs, or rather ideas and so per say to just bring more customers into buying their products thus a rather "dirty" marketing, however, even though the action might not come from good intentions we could still benefit the spreading of it if they're ideas we actually benefit from and not ideologize people.

It's also rather highly unprovable the fact that one company might pursue a specific type of marketing while actually incentivize this new progessive ideas without having the intention of just getting more clients into their market, which makes it harder to divide the one who actually belive in the progressive idea and support from the one that they actually  don't.

While i might consider some progressive ideas of our current society good to be spread, on the other way some may promote unhealthy lifestyles (and other dangerous ideologies) in which people might use them as a coping mechanism to never leave their bubble of comfort zone, like the "body positvity" one which it is a good way of thinking about our bodies, but may be used by overlyfat/fat people to just not improve their lifestyle to make healthy decision and range between healthy bodyfat percentage. As long as you're in the scientific proven healthy range, it's okay to feel good with one's own body, we shouldn't need to change it or modify it.

Obivously this current stream of thought should not be used in contrast of the pepole who want to get also a better body for themselves, statement like: "just be good with your own, you should accept yourself",  don't hold any value here, if you're PERSONALY happy with your body, then it is indeed good but someone might strive for a better phyisic and as shapeable as we our we're allowed to make what we want of ourself as long as you're doing for your ownself.

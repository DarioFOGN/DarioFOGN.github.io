                    <p>Here's the definition of "woke capitalism":<br>
                        "Woke capitalism" refers to a business strategy where companies attempt to align themselves with social justice causes and appeal to consumers who are concerned with issues such as racial and gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental sustainability. This approach involves not only taking a public stance on these issues but also implementing policies and practices that reflect these values within the company.<br> The problem with Woke Capitalism it's at the fundaments of where it stands as Company should in my opinion focus more on their actual product and on what they offer as the "mission" of the company instead of using progressive ideas as what the company represents(...)

                <p>they are for sure part of one's own human true nature they are derived by our own actions and events
                    that happens to us in our journey, but why modern society put so much pressure or they made emotions
                    so relevant. Do people get driven by them, do they let control and shape them? probably its humanly
                    normal to be shapen by them, even if you try to control them, and guide them to their places they'll
                    come back for you, and once you'll face them back they're gonna hit harder than ever. It has
                    happened recently to me, once i resurfaced what i thought it was lost in the most small fragment of
                    my "mind" they all surfaced back together, reminding of (...)

                <p>in my life I've been actually discussing multiple times about this topic, with multiple persons,
                    which they would've told me "Yeah, i belive in science", as if science is a belif system likewise
                    religions, well it's not true at all, because there's a big difference between religion and
                    science..
                    and that is that one is based on empirical data, and proved all along while the other, its just some
                    really old fantasy book in which none of the things written in it have any actual evidence. So it is
                    indeed a belif system, something that you belive in order to make the information contained in them
                    within yourself. (...)

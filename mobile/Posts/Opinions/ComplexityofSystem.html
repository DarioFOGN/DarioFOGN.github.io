            <h1>The Complexity of our System</h1>
            <div class="date">Sun 11 June 2023</div>
            <p>in the midst of the chaos we live in of which it is called life, we upon many indifferent reasons live this seemingly life full of superficialities which might make us feel us less worse within this reality of which nothing seems real. Thinking about the complexity of the system we live in, makes me wonder if we truly understands the surrounding of our life, i would say we do not, because as science is, it is just the description of the phenomenon of which our universe work but as a description it just describe the forces that governantes the universe and ourselves but doesn't give us the reason (of which i believe doesn't exist at all) of our life and so it makes me wonder what really makes us strive for a better understanding of ourselves and the outside if we don't have the reason to even exist, the survival of our specie and the spread of new human beings it's just not an enough reason for a sense self-fulfillment, as modern life just makes it seems obvious, there's the crisis of motif to live in our life especially among the younger and so again how did my parents and everyone of which surrounds me, have lived, without a minimal reasonable question of: "Why".
            We say "it is what it is" but as i think more throughly about the phrase itself it's just resignation of our understanding of our surrounding. it doesn't even help us that the system in which we live in: "capitalism" repacked from its classical to the neoclassical times; its just a system to exploit the less poorer and workers of lower class, within this ideal of just reach the same class status of the great earnest in which only 1% of the worldwide population can achieve otherwise you'll have to live in the middle-poorer class that substantially earn so much less than the upper-class jobs.
            Our most inflated ideology which is individualism, it is at it's core a wrong indoctrination in which assume that within finding ourselves we found self-realization, but it is in our human instinct and desire to surround ourself in a community where we share value and find values and so because we are what others are, what we might think it's our understanding it is just the influences of our surrounding that dictates them.
            You can just see how fragile our ideas can be as soon as challenged with more sources (reading, etc.), and how much we do not know, and yet still will do not.</p>

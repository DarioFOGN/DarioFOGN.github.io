            <p>Here's the definition of "woke capitalism":<br>
                "Woke capitalism" refers to a business strategy where companies attempt to align themselves with social justice causes and appeal to consumers who are concerned with issues such as racial and gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental sustainability. This approach involves not only taking a public stance on these issues but also implementing policies and practices that reflect these values within the company.<br> The problem with Woke Capitalism it's at the fundaments of where it stands as Company should in my opinion focus more on their actual product and on what they offer as the "mission" of the company instead of using progressive ideas as what the company represents(...)
